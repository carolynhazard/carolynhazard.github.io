        <h3> Background</h3>
        <p>Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of
        the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under
        King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came
        to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a
        Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's
        defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy
        in 1946 and economic revival followed.</p>
        <p>Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community
        (EEC) and its subsequent successors the EC and the EU. It has been at
        the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic
        and Monetary Union in 1999.</p>
        <p> Persistent problems include sluggish
        economic growth, high youth and female unemployment, organized
        crime, corruption, and economic disparities between southern Italy
        and the more prosperous north.</p>
